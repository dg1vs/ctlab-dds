DDS C Firmware Port

Features
--------

(* denotes features not included in original firmware)

- wide range input for all parameters with encoder using acceleration*
  (no range switching necessary)
- scrolling* for long parameter names to avoid unreadable abbreviations
- frequency selection from 0.015625 Hz (1/64 Hz) to 300 kHz*
- output level adjustment (RMS, 0.025 mV - 8.191 V, resolution 0.025 mV 
  [up to 200 mV], 1 mV [above 200 mV]), selectable in Volt or dB
- offset adjustment (-10.0 V - +10.0 V, resolution 5 mV)
- waveform selection:
	- off
	- sine
	- triangle
	- square
	- logic (high and low level adjustable separately*)
	- external
- burst mode (on and off time adjustable separately*)
- sweep* with 5 ms time resolution:
	- modes: sweep up, down, up+down
	- start frequency and end frequency
	- sweep time (100 ms - 30 s, resolution 1 ms)
- TRMSC support:
	- range selection including autorange* feature
	- RMS and Peak voltage display, selectable in Volt or dB
	- permanent* measurement display (selectable RMS or Peak voltage
	  displaying after one second encoder/button inactivity independent
	  of currently selected parameter)
